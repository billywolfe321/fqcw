Features:

FlagginGood offers a range of features to enhance your gaming experience:
Daily Challenge: Test your flag knowledge with a daily challenge. Start with a blurred flag and guess the correct country by entering its name in a text box. After five incorrect attempts, you'll receive a hint about the continent the flag originates from. You have made a total of 11 attempts to solve the challenge.
Main Game: Navigate through different continents, guessing flags as they appear. Keep an eye on your remaining lives and the progress counter. When you guess correctly, the button briefly turns green and advances to the next question. A red button indicates an incorrect answer, prompting you to try again. You cannot select the same incorrect answer twice, ensuring a challenging and fair experience.

Use Cases:

FlagginGood has evolved through different use cases, with each iteration improving functionality and design. Here's a breakdown of the main use cases:

Home Screen: The home screen features the title and four buttons: "Colour Selector," "Settings," "Play," and "Daily Challenge."

Settings: The settings section provides information on how to play the game and offers a contact option. Pop-up buttons with close functionality make navigation intuitive.

Colour Selector: Customise your gaming experience by changing the background colour throughout the application, providing a unique and personalised feel.

Daily Challenge: The daily challenge presents a blurred flag that gradually becomes clearer with each incorrect answer. Submit the country's name in a text box to solve the challenge. After 24 hours, a new daily challenge awaits.

Quiz Screens: Select your continent from the main game screen, including an "All Countries" mode. A flag will appear, and you'll have four options to guess from. Incorrect answers deduct a life, indicated by the changing color of the life counter. Correct answers momentarily turn the button green and lead you to the next level. 

Quiz Pop-ups: Receive feedback with pop-ups indicating whether you've won or lost the challenge.

Flaggin Good offers an enjoyable and educational experience for flag enthusiasts and those looking to expand their global knowledge. Have fun and test your skills today!
